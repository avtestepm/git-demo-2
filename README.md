# git-demo-2
I didn't use file managers, GUI text editors, gitk / git gui from the very beginning. 
I used the browser only for github operations.
Everything else was only through the console.
That is why there was no reason to redo the tasks again.
But later I got familiar with GUI text editors, gitk / git gui.
